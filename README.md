# Investigation
Analysing a dataset and communicating findings
This project used data for people who showed up for doctor's appointment and for those who did not show up.
I investigated a dataset and showed my findings.
My research questions were as follows: Is there a relationship between the number of people who received SMSs and the number of people who show up for appointments?
Which age attended the most appointments?
What is the median age of people who were booked for appointment?
My main findings were as follows: The number of people who went for appointments were higher than those who did not go, for both groups who received SMSs and not received SMSs. There is no relationship between the number of people who received SMSs and the attendence of appointment. People at the age of zero are the ones who attended most of the appointments. The median age of people who were booked for appointments was 37.00.
